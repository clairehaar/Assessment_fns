# Here is a little function you can use to convert between coordinate systems it should take whatever coordinate
# system you like and convert between them.  There are also a number of "custom" y/x coordinate boxes 
# that can be used to generate the boundaries for plot boxes (which was the original intent of this function.
# DK created December 2018

# Arguements
#1  plot.extent:  The coordinates you want in a dataframe with y and x coordinates specfied, or you can use one of the names below 
#2  in.csys:     The cooridanate system of the data you entered in th plot.extent.  Default is Lat/Lon with WGS84
#3  out.csys:    The cooridanate system you want to convert your y/x coordinates to. Default is "WGS84"
#4  bbox.buf:    Do you want to add a buffer to the bounding box, set as a percentage of the distance between your longitudes.  Setting this to 0.05 would set a buffer of
#                 5% of this distance.  Default is 0 which no buffer.
#  make.sf:       Do you want the output to be an sf object, default = F to ensure backwards compatibility to other
