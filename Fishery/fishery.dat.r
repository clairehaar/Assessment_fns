####  Commented and checked by DK starting on July 28, 2015.  This function is used to select the CPUE data that 
# we want use tp calculate annual CPUE's and s.e.'s
### Revisions
## 
## May 2017, revised the BBn survyr bit to work if there are no NA's in the data.
# March 2018, revised to GBa section so that the script works when looking at a small portion of the bank (the merge function was broken for GBa when 
# you zoom in and don't have data for both GBa and GBb banks and are looking before 1999...

#fishery.data:  Fishery data from logs_and_fishery_data.r. 
#yr:        The years of interest.  Default is to use all years from 1955 to current year.  Note that since this is using output from logs_and_fishery_data.r 
#            ensure that the years in the call to that function include the years used in this function.
#bk:        Which bank to select from using abbreviated bank id.  Default is GBa (Georges Bank)
#           The options are: 
#             "GBa": Georges a 
#             "GBb": Georges b 
#   	        "BBn": Browns north 
#             "BBs": Browns south 
#             "Ger": German 
#       	    "Mid": Middle 
#       	    "Sab": Sable 
#       	    "Ban": Banquereau 
#       	    "SPB": St. Pierre Bank
#nafo.div:   Used if interested in a particular NAFO division within the bank chosen.  This will 
#            always just look at CPUE in NAFO division on the bank chosen. There are currently 42 
#            possible NAFO areas to choose from (any combination of the 42 is acceptable just 
#            ensure they align with the bank):
#Gin:       Use the table gbcatch which includes historic calculations of the actual catch on Georges 
#           Bank. (T/F) default is F.
#export:	  Export the annual CPUE table.  (T/F) default is F
#method:	  How are we calculating the annual CPUE + variance, options are "avgdaily" and
#           "jackknife".  Default option is "avgdaily' which is simply calculating the mean for the year + 
#           ariance using every data point available.  The preferred, yet slower if using large datasets, 
#           option is to use 'jackknife' function based on Smith(1980) to  obtain an unbiased estimate of CPUE and its variance.
#model.out: Specifiy the 'out' object to have a specific format.  (T/F) default is F.
#period:  	Are we looking at the calendar year or the survey year.  Calendar year = 'calyr' while	survey year ='survyr'    
#surv: 	    If period = 'survyr' do you want to split the data using the spring 'May" or summer 
              #"August" survey.
#direct:    Working directory for data and outputs "Y:/Offshore scallop/Assessment/Assessment_fns/"
#direct_fns: the directory from which to source functions



# source("Y:/Assessment/2011/r/fn/fishery.dat.r")
