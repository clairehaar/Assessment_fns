# Arguments


### May 16, 2016 added options for calling the database which I should have had in before...
# Arguments
# direct:       The root directory to work from  Default = "Y:/Offshore scallop/Assessment", 
# yrs:          The year(s0) you want to check, needs to be 2008 onwards or it'll break. Default is NULL which will pull everything form 2008 to current year
# marfis:       Do you want to check the marfis log or the local logs.  T/F, default is T which checks the marfis logs, if checking the local logs
#               set to F.  NOTE that this will check the logs associated with what you set "direct" to be!!!
# repo:         Where are you getting the functions and the GIS layers from.  Default is 'github' whic pulls in the latest from Github
#               while 'local' searches for the function in a subdirectory of your direct call above
# db.con:       The database to connect to.  Default ="ptran",
# un:           Your username to connect to SQL database.  Default = un.ID
# pw:           Your password to connect to SQL database.  Default = pwd.ID
# db.lib:       Do you want to use "ROracle" (the default) or "RODBC", the old way
# bank:         The bank you are interested in checking, can be one, multiple, or all banks at once.  Default = NULL which will use all data, to select
#               a bank you need to use the 3 digit codes (e.g. "GBa","BBn",)
# trips:        Do you want to just look at specfic trips.  Default is NULL (looks at everything for the year)
# dates:        Do you want to just look for trips that fished within a certain range.  Default is NULL. 
#               For one day enter like: dates="YYYY-MM-DD"
#               For a date range enter as: dates=c("YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD") where the first date is the beginning and the second date is the end of the range.
# tow.time:     What is the range of tow times you want to check.  default = c(3,80) which will flag tow times < 3 and > 80.
# trip.tol:     What is the tolerance you want for comparing the slip weights with the trip weights from the logs.  Options include
#               a: 'exact' which will flag trips that aren't exact matches, this may flag a lot of trips that are only off due to rounding error
#               b:  enter a numeric value to search for trips in which the weight of the logs and slips differ by given amount.  For example
#                   trip.tol = 100 will flag trips in which the difference between the sum of the slip and sum of the trip weight is > 100 lbs.
#                   Default is 1 lb which is pretty much equivalent to rounding to the nearest whole number.
# spatial       Do you want to make spatial plots of the trips.  T/F, default = T.
# reg.2.plot    A few options here, the default is NULL.  What this does is to create a zoomed in plot focused on a bounding box around the
#               points in each tow.  If you want to plot a bank or a region just put that here, see pecjector for 
#               region names that work (e.g. "GBa","GBb", "SS", "BOF", etc) if you want to plot a specific area
#               you can enter the coordinates and the projection system, likely you'll never need to mess with the projection system
#               so adding something like this where you change the x and y values should do the trick.
#               data.frame(y = c(40,46),x = c(-68,-55),proj_sys = "+init=epsg:4326")
#               Note that for mutiple trips the NULL option will zoom in on each trip, whereas the non-NULL option will plot the
#               same region for every trip.
# plot          "shiny" if you want to run the shiny app. "pdf" if you want to print the pdfs. 
# export        Do you want to export the results to a xlsx spreadsheet.  Default is NULL which doesn't export anything.
#               export = "fish.dat" will put a file in the Assessment/yr/log_Checks/ folder with a name that attempts to
#               highlight what you have tested, alternatively you can enter your own name and save it wherever you'd like.
